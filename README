confu is a simplistic config parser for node.js


Installation:
  npm install confu

  
Usage:
  var config = require('confu')(__dirname, '../', 'config.json');
  
Also see example.js and config.json in the package

  
Why is this even useful?

Well, if you have a 'paths' hash in your config object, paths are resolved and normalized, relatively to the path of your config file, so you don't have to do it yourself. Also shamelessly adds a paths.root and paths.config path for convenience.

So, in short, put your 'public', 'views' etc. paths in a 'paths' hash.

Also saves you the trouble of requiring 'fs' and 'path' just to read a config file if you don't need them anywhere else.


Example config.json:

  { "name": "myapp"
  , "host": "localhost"
  , "port": 80
  , "paths": 
    { "public": "./public"
    , "views": "./views"
    , "absolute": "/path/to/absolute/thing"
    }
  }

In your app 'config' will look like:

  { name: 'myapp',
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 80,
    paths:
     { public: '/cygdrive/h/work/node/repos/confu/public',
       views: '/cygdrive/h/work/node/repos/confu/views',
       absolute: '/path/to/absolute/thing',
       root: '/cygdrive/h/work/node/repos/confu',
       config: '/cygdrive/h/work/node/repos/confu/config.json' } }
